    <h2>Cc Help</h2>
    <p>Cc stands for Carbon Copy. When you Cc someone to an email, you are sending them a copy of the email.</p>
    <p>You should add someone in as a Cc if the email is not meant for them, but if it contains information they should know about.</p>
    <p>For example, you could Cc your supervisor to let them know an action has been taken or to provide a record of communications.</p>
    <p>It is important to not Cc too often, as it could become annoying and cumbersome to the person you are Cc-ing.</p>
    <br>
    <p>You CC someone in the same way you add someone to the To box. Either by typing in the CC box:</p>
    <img src = "CCBox.png">
    <p>Or by selecting them from the drop down menu</p>
