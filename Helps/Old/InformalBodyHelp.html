    <h3>Greeting</h3>
    <p>
        Because this is an informal email, meaning you have a friendly, personal relationship with the recipient, you can afford to be more
        casual in your greeting. <br>Here are some examples:
    </p>

    <p>Hi [Name],</p>
    <p>Hello, </p>
    <p>Hello [Name],</p>
    <p>Hi everyone, <strong><em>(Use this when addressing multiple people)</em></strong></p>
    <p>Hello everyone, <strong><em>(Use this when addressing multiple people)</em></strong></p>
    <p>Hey,</p>
    <p>Hey [Name],</p>

    <br>
    <h3>Body</h3>
    <p>
        The first paragraph should set the tone and
        reason for the email. Then elaborate on your concerns, questions <br>or response. Write in a way that is easy to understand
        while also making sure to not lose your point by providing unnecessary information. <br>When responding make sure you
        answer any questions that the recipinet has asked. Only give information that is required.
        <br><br>You also add links, images and attachments.
    </p>

    <br>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
     This is your closing email. Think of it as an ending of a conversation. You will need a closing line, this is line should
     show graditude for the recipient for reading<br>your email and a statement that will either motivate the recipient to respond or
     shows you anticipate a response. Here is a simple example of a closing: </p>
    <p>Thank you,
    <br><br>[Your Name]</p>

    <a href="#top">Back to top</a>
    <br><br>
    <a data-role= "button" class = "btn normalButton" onclick = "window.history.back()">Go Back</a>
