# the DisplayEmail module is used for displaying the list of emails for all systems
# We can test everything for this module from the student basic system.

#check if list loaded properly
  # check if alert message for number of unread emails present
  # check if yellow text present
  # check if email0 present <==== need to send and receive an email before we run this test!!!

# check unread email => make someone send an email to it and check how it appears

# click check box => click check box for email0 and see what happens
    # i guess we can check css classnames
# delete email => delete email0
    # check if email disappears
